### I. Ontology

#### 1.1 Dynamic Existence

All possibilities instantaneously reside within the "possibility substrate" as latent facts or undetermined existences. The fundamental nature of existence manifests as a continuously unfolding generative process; there are no static, completed deterministic entities. (2025-02-19)

Determinacy is not preexisting but emerges as a secondary construct through participatory agency within the possibility substrate. (2025-02-19) When labeling phenomena as "determinate," we observe temporary stabilizations of possibility distributions by specific conscious structures at particular observational scales. Determinacy is possibility not yet locked by observation; their sole distinction lies in observational engagement. (2025-02-26)

#### 1.2 Emergence of Determinacy

Consciousness operates as a filtering mechanism for possibilities, converging latent potentials through observation. Consciousness at varying observational strata continuously interprets convergence outcomes as phenomenal determinacy. Each stratum maintains distinct characteristics while exchanging convergence results with adjacent layers. (2025-02-19)

From elementary particles to living organisms, all exhibit consciousness traits across strata, each constructing determinate realities through unique methodologies, resulting in differentiated capacities to interpret reality. (2025-02-11) Human consciousness represents a specialized pattern-recognition mode adapted to material strata, where distinct consciousness layers employ different "pattern recognition" protocols. (2025-01-03) Quantum probabilities at micro scales solidify into classical entities at macro scales. (2025-02-20)

Material "determinacy" originates from sustained multi-strata observational consensus, where each stratum builds correspondingly precise cognitive models of material structures. (2025-01-08) Cross-subject observational verification forms positive feedback loops: observational outcomes at one stratum delimit observable ranges for others, ultimately converging into "objective existence." (2025-01-03)

Observer typology dictates phenomenal manifestation. (2024-12-20) Macro-material stability arises from iterative convergence of multi-strata observations, while quantum indeterminacy reveals observational divergences between distinct observers. (2025-02-12)

#### 1.3 Spacetime & Causality

Spatiotemporal continuity stems from human consciousness and embodiment collaboratively processing dynamic existence through specific protocols. Sustained application of homologous observational methods translates sequential material pattern recognition into the experience of temporality as uniform flow within preexisting spatial frameworks. (2022-04-24) This continuity constitutes neither inherent physical property nor pure illusion, but rather an emergent byproduct of conscious pattern recognition. (2025-01-03) Spacetime exists as the generalized process through which human consciousness and embodiment handle sequential information. (2023-09-21)

When multi-strata consciousnesses share specific observational methods, their synergistic phenomena reinforce the stability of those methods. (2025-02-19) Iterative interactions between consciousness strata form stabilized possibility convergence pathways, with reinforced convergence processes eventually crystallizing into "causal laws." (2025-02-22)

#### 1.4 Subject-Object Unity

Determinacy and free will achieve unified explanation: determinacy represents universal observational consensus, while free will constitutes available residual capacity within unlocked possibility spaces. (2024-10-17) Subjects improvise within rule frameworks while reciprocally reshaping possibility distributions through their actions, generating spiral evolutionary paths of reality. When observational divergence occurs, subjects intervene through secondary convergence to achieve framework innovation. (2025-02-16)

Observer and observed phenomena fundamentally constitute different actualizations of the same existential mode, maintaining symbiotic coexistence through information exchange. Existential states are essentially possibility snapshots filtered by observer typologies. Alterations in observer types or methods lock different possibility snapshots. Consciousness is not a passive witness but an essential participant in reality's self-actualization. (2024-12-20)

### II. Epistemology

#### 2.1 Procedural Completeness

Cognition inherently operates as an open system, progressively generating incomplete mappings of possible worlds. Judgments function as real-time feedback mechanisms, not as vectors toward ultimate truth (2024-04-22), but as temporary markers of cognitive boundaries. (2024-07-25)

This dynamism negates static perfection in cognition. (2023-10-04) Any claims of epistemic completeness inherently await revision. Human cognition establishes temporary stability through iterative trial-and-error, constructing phased cognitive maps via "optimal failure path" selection. Crucially, cognitive completeness resides in iterative capacity rather than conclusion finality. (2025-01-11)

#### 2.2 Bidirectional Linguistic Representation

Language systems construct cognitive frameworks yet perpetually interfere with cognition through their instrumental nature. (2024-09-13)

- **Constructive Function**: Semantic networks form cognitive coordinate systems, where lexical density determines conceptual connectivity. (2023-11-16)
- **Constrictive Effects**:
  1. Linguistic abstraction inherently causes experiential loss, creating explanatory gaps between descriptions and phenomena
  2. Linguistic violence subtly distorts cognition through "contextual pollution" (2021-06-20)

Language-based cognitive modeling requires vigilance: language remains exploratory toolkits, with any single expression constituting mere 2D projections of cognitive hypercubes. Guard against semantic inflation eroding conceptual boundaries; maintain dynamic equilibrium between naming and cognition. (2024-09-13)

#### 2.3 Theoretical Constraints

All theories constitute reduced-dimensional projections of reality under limited perspectives. (2023-10-07) Their validity faces three constraints:

1. Observational strata dictate representational limitations
2. Co-constitution of observer and environment imbues theories with subjective imprints
3. Temporal decay in explanatory power

Theoretical finitude doesn't negate value but establishes their role as transitional cognitive stations—theories achieve metabolic renewal through continuous "re-observation." (2024-09-13)

#### 2.4 Concepts & Consensus

Conceptual evolution exhibits dissipative structure characteristics. Practice and theory co-evolve within conceptual ecosystems: differing theories/practices generate differing concepts that lock distinct possibility snapshots. Practice provides emergent soil for theories; theories construct navigational frameworks for practice. (2021-01-31)

When explanatory frameworks demonstrate predictive/utility value, individuals/groups form consensual concepts through "comparative validation." (2024-02-23) Established consensus then reciprocally shapes perception, forming cognitive closure. (2025-02-16)

### III. Theory of Order

#### 3.1 Limited Order

Social order constitutes adaptive steady-state structures emerging from macro-level human interactions as observing agents. Through "conceptual exchange" and "divergence negotiation," agents across cognitive strata form operational consensus—explicit rules (laws, technical standards) and implicit contracts (traditions, tacit agreements). Consensus systems decompose into concrete architectures: power distribution dictates rule enforcement, resource allocation influences interest flows, generating differentiated "order morphologies." (2021-08-14)

Consensus temporality and stratification drive social evolution: short-term consensus resolves immediate conflicts but falters against systemic contradictions; long-term consensus requires multi-cycle game-theoretic interactions to crystallize into stable traditions. Local consensus holds validity within groups yet often conflicts with broader collective goals. Consensus succession constitutes order evolution's core dynamics: existing consensus maintains surface stability through institutional rigidity while new concepts permeate boundaries. Their conflict intensity dictates order trajectories—gradual adaptation, violent restructuring, or prolonged stagnation. Order persistence depends on collective capacity to absorb/resolve contradictions. (2024-09-19)

#### 3.2 Hierarchical Transmission of Power

Sustained order evolution creates differential possibility convergence capacities among agents, forming "power hierarchies." Structural advantages enable dominant groups to reshape societal possibility distributions. Dominant agents wield large-scale evaluative authority, while subordinate groups perform secondary evaluations within dominant frameworks.

In virtuous systems, dominant agents dissolve pressure transmission through responsibility mechanisms, constraining evaluations within public domains via institutional design. Vicious systems allow dominant groups to transfer systemic costs (e.g., technological monopolies exacerbating inequality). The latter causes evaluative asymmetry—separation between decision-makers and consequence-bearers—fundamentally undermining consensus-building symmetry.

#### 3.3 Evaluative System Alienation

Alienation arises inevitably from vicious power hierarchies. Consider market economies:

Primordial transactions featured symmetrical evaluative power between suppliers/consumers. As complexity increased, third parties monopolized evaluation, reducing dynamic consensus-building to static unilateral certification. (2024-09-19) Manifestations include:

- Cognitive monopolization through technical jargon proliferation
- Agent dissolution via eroded autonomous evaluation capacities
- Complex systems with expanding yet diminishing evaluative dimensions

Digitalization exacerbates alienation: algorithmic recommendation systems create closed cognitive loops through data modeling; platform economies reconstruct value coordinates via information monopolies. This constitutes technical deprivation of evaluative rights, transforming markets from value-discovery tools into control mechanisms. Building virtuous evaluation ecosystems requires not technical reform but agent empowerment and public deliberative frameworks. (2024-10-11)

#### 3.4 Dynamic Evolution

Institutional systems represent historically achieved game-theoretic equilibria. Dominant groups solidify value standards into coercive norms—legal codes, cultural traditions, etc. Subordinate groups respond via:

1. Exploiting institutional gaps
2. Building parallel systems (2023-05-26)

Surface institutions maintain formal stability while deep rules undergo adaptive adjustments. The contradiction between apparent stability and latent flux drives institutional evolution. True social resilience lies not in resisting change but in transformative absorption of disruptive elements. (2024-05-28)
